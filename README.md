# Current Status : Castagne v0.51
The project is stable, but still a bit incomplete. Some small changes in behaviour may still happen as potential bugs are fixed.
Castagne v0.51 is
Rollback worked with Castagne v0.2, it will certainly need a second pass now that the refactoring is done.

Next version is going to be Castagne v0.6, [see the roadmap](http://panthavma.com/articles/castagne-roadmap-v1) for details.
The objective is to create all the structures needed around the game, like menus, training mode, etc.

Most of the development of Castagne will follow the development of Kronian Titans itself.
